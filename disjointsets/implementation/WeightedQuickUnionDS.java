/**
 * Weighted QuickUnion is the same as QuickUnion with an added optimization,
 * that guarantees the smaller (in size) tree is connected to the larger tree.
 * this is achieved by keeping track of an additional size array, so before
 * making a connect operation we check the sizes of the trees rooted at
 * p's root and q's root, and connect the smaller tree to the larger one.
 * By doing so we guarantee the height of the tree will be at most logN,
 * thus the find operation will have to climb logN at the worst case.
 * (there is a formal proof by strong induction for that,
 * but I think the following proof sketch is enough to convince you, well I hope:))
 *
 * (Proof sketch: Say we have an element x in a Tree T1.
 *  The depth of x increases by 1 only when T1 is placed below another tree T2.
 *  When that happens, the size of the resulting tree will be at least double the size of T1 because
 *  size(T2) >= size(T1). The tree with x can double at most logN times until we've reached a total of N items.
 *  So we can double up to logN times and each time, our tree adds a level â†’ maximum logN levels.)
